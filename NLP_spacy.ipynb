Free health/fitness assessments.  Dogfriendly.  Etc. etc. etc.  3 Compensation.  In ~2010 or 2011, Google updated its compensation packages so that they were more competitive.    4 For the size of the organization 30K+, it has remained relatively innovative, nimble, and fastpaced and open with communication but, that is definitely changing for the worse.  5 With so many departments, focus areas, and products, in theory, you should have plenty of opportunity to grow your career horizontally or vertically.  In practice, not true.    6  You get to work with some of the brightest, most innovative and hardworking/diligent minds in the industry.  There's a \"con\" to that, too see below.</td>\n",
       "      <td>1 Work/life balance.  What balance?  All those perks and benefits are an illusion.  They keep you at work and they help you to be more productive.  I've never met anybody at Google who actually time off on weekends or on vacations.  You may not hear management say, \"You have to work on weekends/vacations\" but, they set the culture by doing so  and it inevitably trickles down.  I don't know if Google inadvertently hires the workaholics or if they create workaholics in us.  Regardless, I have seen way too many of the following: marriages fall apart, colleagues choosing work and projects over family, colleagues getting physically sick and ill because of stress, colleagues crying while at work because of the stress, colleagues shooting out emails at midnight, 1am, 2am, 3am.  It is absolutely ridiculous and something needs to change.  2 Poor management.  I think the issue is that, a majority of people love Google because they get to work on interesting technical problems  and these are the people that see little value in learning how to develop emotional intelligence.  Perhaps they enjoy technical problems because people are too \"difficult.\"  People are promoted into management positions  not because they actually know how to lead/manage, but because they happen to be smart or because there is no other path to grow into.  So there is a layer of intelligent individuals who are horrible managers and leaders.  Yet, there is no value system to actually do anything about that because \"emotional intelligence\" or \"adaptive leadership\" are not taken seriously.  3 Jerks.  Sure, there are a lot of brilliant people  but, sadly, there are also a lot of jerks and, many times, they are one and the same.  Years ago, that wasn't the case.  I don't know if the pool of candidates is getting smaller, or maybe all the folks with great personalities cashed out and left, or maybe people are getting burned out and it's wearing on their personality and patience.  I've heard stories of managers straightup cussing out their employees and intimidating/scaring their employees into compliance.  4 It's a giant company now and, inevitably, it has become slower moving and is now layered with process and bureaucracy.  So many political battles, empire building, territory grabbing.  Google says, \"Don't be evil.\"  But, that practice doesn't seem to be put into place when it comes to internal practices.  :</td>\n",

       "      <td>If you're a software engineer, you're among the kings of the hill at Google. It's an engineerdriven company without a doubt that is changing, but it's still very engineerfocused.  The perks are amazing. Yes, free breakfast, lunch, an dinner every weekday. Aaaaaamazing holiday parties at Waldorf Astoria, NY Public Library, MoMA, etc.; overnight ski trips to Vermont; overnight nature trips to the Poconos in the summer; summer picnics at Chelsea piers; and on and on and on. I don't see this going away unless the company starts hurting financially.  Speaking of which, the company is doing quite well, which reflects in bonuses and equity grants.  There a huge diversity of work ranging from defending independent journalism worldwide Google Project Shield to crisis response during disasters see Maps during Hurricane Sandy or Tsunamis, to the best machine learning experts and projects in the world, to more mundane revenuedriving projects in advertising, there's really something for everybody.  It's easy to move around within the company as long as you're in good standing the vast majority of engineers are.  The company is amazingly open: every week Larry Page and Sergey Brin host what's called TGIF where food, beer, wine, etc. is served, a new project is presented, and afterward there's an open forum to ask the executives anything you want. It's truly fair game to ask anything, no matter how controversial, and frequently the executives will be responsive.  No, nobody cares if you use an iPhone, Facebook, shop with Amazon, stream using Spotify, or refuse to use Google+. The company is amazingly open and flexible.  Neither pro nor con, but general information on worklife balance, promotions, and advancement.  Work life balance can be what you want it to be on most teams. Some teams are in more competitive sectors and require more crazy hours all the time  but very few of them. If you do what's expected, you'll be fine at least for a handful of years. Working a roughly 40 hour work week is possible, and many people do it. There are also people who are hypermotived and work like crazy just because they love it, or because they're competitive, or they want to get a promotion. If you work 40 hour weeks without putting in anything extra, you'll fall behind them as they advance and you stand still  and maybe that doesn't matter, so it works out for everybody. But at least know where you would realistically stand.  If you excel and work your butt off, you'll be compensated and promoted. If you let yourself be a code monkey, and just sit coding with your head down all day, you'll be fine but won't advance. A big complaint from some Googlers is about not being able to advance \"even at Google\" with pure coding. Sure, if you're the uber genius who created MapReduce and Bigtable, you're going to advance like a rocket without having to do anything but coding; but if you're like most engineers at Google  smarter than average, but just average compared to other Googlers  you're just a good coder and not revolutionary. Code monkeys are important to actually get stuff done, and to be sure you absolutely need to be a good coder as a software engineer it's the minimum requirement, but code monkeys won't advance because they're not leaders and they're easy to replace. To get promoted you need to lead and do more than just code. There are plenty of ways to lead other than being an official tech lead, so this isn't actually _that_ hard, so the real point is just that you can't just sit there coding what other people tell you to code all day and expect to advance.</td>\n",
       "      <td>It is becoming larger, and with it comes growing pains: bureaucracy, slow to respond to market threats, bloated teams, crossdivisional tension though nothing remotely approaching that of Microsoft's internal tension.  The quality of the engineers is possibly dropping, but possibly not. It's hard to get real metrics, because as the absolute number of people grows, naturally the number of bad apples grows; as a percentage it's supposedly the same as it ever was, but with larger numbers of poorer quality engineers it just _feels_ like things might be changing for the worse.  Also with growth means more internalconfidential data leaks again, because of the raw numbers of people  product announcements being ruined, etc. That means the company has to be tighterlipped internally to avoid leaks, which makes things less open. It's still an amazingly open place, but less so than it was even a couple years ago. The good thing is they recognize it and actively look to improve things because they know how important it is to keep the good culture.</td>\n",

They are brilliant, goofy, low key but intense, and likeable.   There are 22 cafes more or less, the food is excellent, and it's free.  Your pay will typically be competitive, though it needs to be tweaked up a bit since the economy has improved.  Google cares about how it treats its employees.  The campus is like an academic campus in many ways.  There are tons of activities on campus, like authors speaking about their books, films after work, and gyms where you can work out  but you'll need to make sure to carve out time to do these things.  You'll get plenty of external validation from people who suddenly think you're smart and rich because you work there, even if you're not rich and you're as smart when you didn't work at Google.  If and when you leave, you'll never regret having that company on your resume. It opens doors.   The company is flexible  if you're lucky, you won't have a micromanager boss and you can be somewhat flexible in how you work  but don't get me wrong  you'll work a LOT.

       "      <td>I live in SF so the commute can take between 1.5 hours to 1.75 hours each way on the shuttle  sometimes 2 hours each way on a busy day or rainy day. That means being on the bus for 34 hours PER DAY. It's a wired bus though which means you can work on the way to Mountain View. But it can feel brutal.  Your first year or two are really important in terms of your career at Google and they affect how you're viewed, and your ability to be promoted. You should always ask to work on high profile projects. If you don't get them, don't expect to get high ratings or get promoted. Always volunteer for cross functional group work for maximum exposure, and then work hard at those things.  You'll likely work on something that no one will explain to you and it will take you at least a year to be comfortable doing what you're working on, even if you're super quick at learning.  No one has time to train you or teach you what you're doing  which is kind of hard.  After two or three years, people you started out with at Google start to get promoted. If you're not one of them, you'll wonder why and how it happened, and that process is somewhat political and not always clear.   It's a big company now. And super political. So don't be naive. Expect some people to be catty, some people to be territorial, and be prepared to be mentally tough. Don't let people see your vulnerableness. It's a Darwinistic culture with a huge dose of 30something idealism on top which can fool you into thinking that people are easygoing  they're not. They're driven. If you're not driven, you're not going to fit in.  When you start at Google, it seems like peer reviews are super important  they are, but they are the sprinkles on the fro yo. The important thing is that your direct manager knows your work, likes your work and likes you, and then you can get promoted. If your boss doesn't like you, all the positive peer reviews in the world won't help you.  Make sure you know what your boss wants, and give it to them. You will have weekly one on ones, and make sure you are addressing your performance at each one, asking if they have questions, how you can improve, can you work on cross functional projects, etc.  It's really hard to find work life balance at Google. The workload is huge.   I hardly have time to work out. The commute is brutal. My family sometimes needs more from me and I can't give it. I'm still trying to find the balance. I think I need more down time than most people so I have a hard time being structured every day to fit all the things I want into my day, so a lot of things slip, like working out.</td>\n",

Minikitchens, snacks, drinks, free breakfast/lunch/dinner, all day, errr'day.  2 Benefits/perks.  Free 24:7 gym access on MTV campus.  Free self service laundry washer/dryer available.  Bowling alley.  Volley ball pit.  Custombuilt and exclusive employee use only outdoor sport park MTV.  Free health/fitness assessments.  Dogfriendly.  Etc. etc. etc.  3 Compensation.  In ~2010 or 2011, Google updated its compensation packages so that they were more competitive.    4 For the size of the organization 30K+, it has remained relatively innovative, nimble, and fastpaced and open with communication but, that is definitely changing for the worse.  5 With so many departments, focus areas, and products, in theory, you should have plenty of opportunity to grow your career horizontally or vertically.  In practice, not true.    6  You get to work with some of the brightest, most innovative and hardworking/diligent minds in the industry.  There's a \"con\" to that, too see below.   \n",
       "1      If you're a software engineer, you're among the kings of the hill at Google. It's an engineerdriven company without a doubt that is changing, but it's still very engineerfocused.  The perks are amazing. Yes, free breakfast, lunch, an dinner every weekday. Aaaaaamazing holiday parties at Waldorf Astoria, NY Public Library, MoMA, etc.; overnight ski trips to Vermont; overnight nature trips to the Poconos in the summer; summer picnics at Chelsea piers; and on and on and on. I don't see this going away unless the company starts hurting financially.  Speaking of which, the company is doing quite well, which reflects in bonuses and equity grants.  There a huge diversity of work ranging from defending independent journalism worldwide Google Project Shield to crisis response during disasters see Maps during Hurricane Sandy or Tsunamis, to the best machine learning experts and projects in the world, to more mundane revenuedriving projects in advertising, there's really something for everybody.  It's easy to move around within the company as long as you're in good standing the vast majority of engineers are.  The company is amazingly open: every week Larry Page and Sergey Brin host what's called TGIF where food, beer, wine, etc. is served, a new project is presented, and afterward there's an open forum to ask the executives anything you want. It's truly fair game to ask anything, no matter how controversial, and frequently the executives will be responsive.  No, nobody cares if you use an iPhone, Facebook, shop with Amazon, stream using Spotify, or refuse to use Google+. The company is amazingly open and flexible.  Neither pro nor con, but general information on worklife balance, promotions, and advancement.  Work life balance can be what you want it to be on most teams. Some teams are in more competitive sectors and require more crazy hours all the time  but very few of them. If you do what's expected, you'll be fine at least for a handful of years. Working a roughly 40 hour work week is possible, and many people do it. There are also people who are hypermotived and work like crazy just because they love it, or because they're competitive, or they want to get a promotion. If you work 40 hour weeks without putting in anything extra, you'll fall behind them as they advance and you stand still  and maybe that doesn't matter, so it works out for everybody. But at least know where you would realistically stand.  If you excel and work your butt off, you'll be compensated and promoted. If you let yourself be a code monkey, and just sit coding with your head down all day, you'll be fine but won't advance. A big complaint from some Googlers is about not being able to advance \"even at Google\" with pure coding. Sure, if you're the uber genius who created MapReduce and Bigtable, you're going to advance like a rocket without having to do anything but coding; but if you're like most engineers at Google  smarter than average, but just average compared to other Googlers  you're just a good coder and not revolutionary. Code monkeys are important to actually get stuff done, and to be sure you absolutely need to be a good coder as a software engineer it's the minimum requirement, but code monkeys won't advance because they're not leaders and they're easy to replace. To get promoted you need to lead and do more than just code. There are plenty of ways to lead other than being an official tech lead, so this isn't actually _that_ hard, so the real point is just that you can't just sit there coding what other people tell you to code all day and expect to advance.   \n",

You'll work on cutting edge projects / solve important issues that impact your community and the world  You'll meet interesting people who are your colleagues, managers, and senior management.  You'll open the paper and see your company in the news almost every day, and read about projects you're working on, which is a cool thing  You'll see Larry and Sergey at TGIF and you'll admire how they lead the company. They are brilliant, goofy, low key but intense, and likeable.   There are 22 cafes more or less, the food is excellent, and it's free.  Your pay will typically be competitive, though it needs to be tweaked up a bit since the economy has improved.  Google cares about how it treats its employees.  The campus is like an academic campus in many ways.  There are tons of activities on campus, like authors speaking about their books, films after work, and gyms where you can work out  but you'll need to make sure to carve out time to do these things.  You'll get plenty of external validation from people who suddenly think you're smart and rich because you work there, even if you're not rich and you're as smart when you didn't work at Google.  If and when you leave, you'll never regret having that company on your resume. It opens doors.   The company is flexible  if you're lucky, you won't have a micromanager boss and you can be somewhat flexible in how you work  but don't get me wrong  you'll work a LOT. But you don't have to do all of it chained to your desk.   \n",

What balance?  All those perks and benefits are an illusion.  They keep you at work and they help you to be more productive.  I've never met anybody at Google who actually time off on weekends or on vacations.  You may not hear management say, \"You have to work on weekends/vacations\" but, they set the culture by doing so  and it inevitably trickles down.  I don't know if Google inadvertently hires the workaholics or if they create workaholics in us.  Regardless, I have seen way too many of the following: marriages fall apart, colleagues choosing work and projects over family, colleagues getting physically sick and ill because of stress, colleagues crying while at work because of the stress, colleagues shooting out emails at midnight, 1am, 2am, 3am.  It is absolutely ridiculous and something needs to change.  2 Poor management.  I think the issue is that, a majority of people love Google because they get to work on interesting technical problems  and these are the people that see little value in learning how to develop emotional intelligence.  Perhaps they enjoy technical problems because people are too \"difficult.\"  People are promoted into management positions  not because they actually know how to lead/manage, but because they happen to be smart or because there is no other path to grow into.  So there is a layer of intelligent individuals who are horrible managers and leaders.  Yet, there is no value system to actually do anything about that because \"emotional intelligence\" or \"adaptive leadership\" are not taken seriously.  3 Jerks.  Sure, there are a lot of brilliant people  but, sadly, there are also a lot of jerks and, many times, they are one and the same.  Years ago, that wasn't the case.  I don't know if the pool of candidates is getting smaller, or maybe all the folks with great personalities cashed out and left, or maybe people are getting burned out and it's wearing on their personality and patience.  I've heard stories of managers straightup cussing out their employees and intimidating/scaring their employees into compliance.  4 It's a giant company now and, inevitably, it has become slower moving and is now layered with process and bureaucracy.  So many political battles, empire building, territory grabbing.  Google says, \"Don't be evil.\"  But, that practice doesn't seem to be put into place when it comes to internal practices.  :   \n",

The quality of the engineers is possibly dropping, but possibly not. It's hard to get real metrics, because as the absolute number of people grows, naturally the number of bad apples grows; as a percentage it's supposedly the same as it ever was, but with larger numbers of poorer quality engineers it just _feels_ like things might be changing for the worse.  Also with growth means more internalconfidential data leaks again, because of the raw numbers of people  product announcements being ruined, etc. That means the company has to be tighterlipped internally to avoid leaks, which makes things less open. It's still an amazingly open place, but less so than it was even a couple years ago. The good thing is they recognize it and actively look to improve things because they know how important it is to keep the good culture.   \n",
       "2     I live in SF so the commute can take between 1.5 hours to 1.75 hours each way on the shuttle  sometimes 2 hours each way on a busy day or rainy day. That means being on the bus for 34 hours PER DAY. It's a wired bus though which means you can work on the way to Mountain View. But it can feel brutal.  Your first year or two are really important in terms of your career at Google and they affect how you're viewed, and your ability to be promoted. You should always ask to work on high profile projects. If you don't get them, don't expect to get high ratings or get promoted. Always volunteer for cross functional group work for maximum exposure, and then work hard at those things.  You'll likely work on something that no one will explain to you and it will take you at least a year to be comfortable doing what you're working on, even if you're super quick at learning.  No one has time to train you or teach you what you're doing  which is kind of hard.  After two or three years, people you started out with at Google start to get promoted. If you're not one of them, you'll wonder why and how it happened, and that process is somewhat political and not always clear.   It's a big company now. And super political. So don't be naive. Expect some people to be catty, some people to be territorial, and be prepared to be mentally tough. Don't let people see your vulnerableness. It's a Darwinistic culture with a huge dose of 30something idealism on top which can fool you into thinking that people are easygoing  they're not. They're driven. If you're not driven, you're not going to fit in.  When you start at Google, it seems like peer reviews are super important  they are, but they are the sprinkles on the fro yo. The important thing is that your direct manager knows your work, likes your work and likes you, and then you can get promoted. If your boss doesn't like you, all the positive peer reviews in the world won't help you.  Make sure you know what your boss wants, and give it to them. You will have weekly one on ones, and make sure you are addressing your performance at each one, asking if they have questions, how you can improve, can you work on cross functional projects, etc.  It's really hard to find work life balance at Google. The workload is huge.   I hardly have time to work out. The commute is brutal. My family sometimes needs more from me and I can't give it. I'm still trying to find the balance. I think I need more down time than most people so I have a hard time being structured every day to fit all the things I want into my day, so a lot of things slip, like working out.   \n",

These can include: 1. High Expectations: Google has a reputation for hiring top talent, which means there's often pressure to meet high expectations and deliver results quickly.  2. Intense Workload: The fastpaced, constantly evolving nature of the tech industry can result in long hours or a sense of burnout for some employees. 3. Internal Competition: With such a large pool of talented people, some individuals might feel a competitive atmosphere that can be stressful. 4. WorkLife Balance: While Google offers flexible work options, the sheer volume of work and the company's fast pace may make it challenging for some employees to maintain a balance between work and personal life. 5. Bureaucracy and Hierarchy: Despite its reputation for innovation, the company is still large and can have bureaucratic layers that may slow decisionmaking or innovation for some teams. Of course, these experiences can vary widely depending on the team, role, and individual preferences.   \n",

You will either get a genuine leader who invests in your growth and success or a someone who pretends but is only there to make themselves look good and will actively make your life hell to push you out.  Holier than thou attitudes of middle managers make it very a very toxic and twofaced environment. If you don't follow blindly you will be pushed out of the company under the facade of \"support\".   Expectations seem to be different for people in the same role depending on if a manager likes you or not.  Untrustworthy people in influential positions who play the politics game instead of actually serving customers.   HR dont take reports of bullying and discrimination seriously enough.  They don't actually care about customers and doing things the right way, its a fake customer first mindset while you're forced to shove products down businesses throats even though it could ruin their business.  Overall  be very cautious of the people around you, because behind the smiles, fake \"we're a team and support each other\" talk and \"Googliness\", there are some who want you to fail.   \n",

This can lead to erratic decisionmaking canceling projects then months later restarting them as competitors did it, people working on the same thing but in nuanced different ways. CVPs really are neglecting areas where the Microsoft brand is strong, in favor of \"red ocean\" areas where Microsoft could succeed but would face tremendous friction. Microsoft is moving to a culture of layoffs where they are not based on performance or any meaningful metric often eliminating people who are incredibly talented devoted and loyal over people who really are stagnant.

Exceptional cultural patience, especially within the New England management team, where time and space were generously given for individuals to grow and integrate. The company’s scale and appetite for calculated risk created abundant opportunities, which I was empowered to pursue and make the most of really making for an awesome career. Microsoft has a remarkable ability to hire genuinely kind and caring individuals. I deeply valued and admired the ICs I worked alongside.   \n",

Double that for vendors.  It is VERY hard to \"stand out\" and move up in the company.  Don't expect your manager to be much of an advocate or enabler to help you meet your career goals  they are basically trying to survive the stack rank every year too.  Not familiar with the stack rank?  Check out the 2012 Vanity Fair article called \"Microsoft's Lost Decade\".   \n",

       "3      Senior leadershipCVP level often impedes progress with decisions that feel disconnected from the realities of product development and customer needs. CVPs and above are disjoint from building and customer feedback process and are difficult and even resistant to involve or inform. This can lead to erratic decisionmaking canceling projects then months later restarting them as competitors did it, people working on the same thing but in nuanced different ways. CVPs really are neglecting areas where the Microsoft brand is strong, in favor of \"red ocean\" areas where Microsoft could succeed but would face tremendous friction. Microsoft is moving to a culture of layoffs where they are not based on performance or any meaningful metric often eliminating people who are incredibly talented devoted and loyal over people who really are stagnant. PM leadership continuously fails to define a strategy in any meaningful way to help organize IC teams.   \n",

Lots of bureaucracy that makes it difficult to truly innovate. Pay is not good enough IMO for the second largest company in the world market cap. Lots of values that are thrown out and sound really good, but in practice  especially as you move up  are essentially thrown out the window. Feels like MSFT bought too many GPUs without figuring out how to make it actually profitable, and the employees are paying the price.   \n",

       "      <td>Disclaimer: A lot of what I'm writing below of course depends on the work area and management chain.  But I found this to be fairly pervasive policies in IBM in my 9+ years with the company.  1. IBM's policies and management are very flexible when it comes to working remotely or accommodating various life situations sick days, doctor visits, etc..  Management is encouraged to measure an employee by their work and impact, and not by hours spent at their office.  2. Great colleagues!  Though unfortunately, many have been leaving due to the instability of IBM's HW development business.  3. At least in my area, there's a high level of flexibility on which projects should I undertake based on my and my management assessment of business impact.</td>\n",
       "      <td>1. Unfortunately, IBM still uses the \"normal distribution\" rating system, where at the end of the year each employee is ranked as a top contributor 5%, above average contributor 15%, average contributor ~75%, and bottom contributor 5%.  This curve is difficult to apply in the R&amp;D world, where you may have many members of the team working long and hard hours, and end up being \"average contributors\" at the end of the year, because there just isn't room for all to be top contributors.   2. The above may not be so disturbing, if only IBM didn't practically cancelled all raises, performance bonuses and incentive for the non topperformers. I've had a consistent \"above average\" rating in the last 45 years, and my raise and performance bonus were ridiculous mere 1.52% of my salary.  Were I rated \"average contributor\" I would have gotten NOTHING. So you can imagine that people can go year after year without any raise to their salary.  From talking to manager friend, this is IBM's way to eliminate the nontopperformers without having to fire them, as part of its direction of reducing US manpower.   3. Hiring freeze in many areas  again, as part of IBM's attempt to reduce its workforce across North America and Europe we see many jobs move to the India and Far East markets.  This is of course upsetting to see local teams shrink and disappear, especially when many great local IBM colleagues and experts begin to drop out. From my experience thus far working with India SW teams  they are still very far away from the standards I would have expected from US and Europe based teams.   4. Poor top down communication about company's and divisions' future.  Employees learn from rumors and news websites what's about to come...</td>\n",

       "1      Disclaimer: A lot of what I'm writing below of course depends on the work area and management chain.  But I found this to be fairly pervasive policies in IBM in my 9+ years with the company.  1. IBM's policies and management are very flexible when it comes to working remotely or accommodating various life situations sick days, doctor visits, etc..  Management is encouraged to measure an employee by their work and impact, and not by hours spent at their office.  2. Great colleagues!  Though unfortunately, many have been leaving due to the instability of IBM's HW development business.  3. At least in my area, there's a high level of flexibility on which projects should I undertake based on my and my management assessment of business impact.   \n",

       "1      1. Unfortunately, IBM still uses the \"normal distribution\" rating system, where at the end of the year each employee is ranked as a top contributor 5%, above average contributor 15%, average contributor ~75%, and bottom contributor 5%.  This curve is difficult to apply in the R&D world, where you may have many members of the team working long and hard hours, and end up being \"average contributors\" at the end of the year, because there just isn't room for all to be top contributors.   2. The above may not be so disturbing, if only IBM didn't practically cancelled all raises, performance bonuses and incentive for the non topperformers. I've had a consistent \"above average\" rating in the last 45 years, and my raise and performance bonus were ridiculous mere 1.52% of my salary.  Were I rated \"average contributor\" I would have gotten NOTHING. So you can imagine that people can go year after year without any raise to their salary.  From talking to manager friend, this is IBM's way to eliminate the nontopperformers without having to fire them, as part of its direction of reducing US manpower.   3. Hiring freeze in many areas  again, as part of IBM's attempt to reduce its workforce across North America and Europe we see many jobs move to the India and Far East markets.  This is of course upsetting to see local teams shrink and disappear, especially when many great local IBM colleagues and experts begin to drop out. From my experience thus far working with India SW teams  they are still very far away from the standards I would have expected from US and Europe based teams.   4. Poor top down communication about company's and divisions' future.  Employees learn from rumors and news websites what's about to come...   \n",

Some senior leaders have been reassigned to lower roles, and there have been salary adjustments, including reductions for those with extensive experience.   For someone motivated by promotion and salary growth, IBM might not currently be the best place, as the company seems to be focusing on hiring younger talent at lower salaries, while experienced employees are experiencing cuts. Nonetheless, IBM remains a respected company with many strengths, but it's important to be aware of these recent changes.   \n",

Customer Success is not truly customer success  it's an organization created as a reaction to an inability to deploy products from Enterprise License Agreements. The primary mission of CS at IBM is to identify use cases, sponsors, budget, and gain commitment to deploy software from ELAs. Those are PREsale activities, not POSTsale CS activities. Just because an ELA was sold does not mean things are actually postsale. An ELA is just a contract vehicle to buy something in the future, a gift card sold at a discount, all the normal sales activities still need to happen.   Sr. team members are being let go in favor of inexpensive, inexperienced new hires.   \n",

As a young player myself, the desire to selfeducate and become more productive with practice and experimentation can sometimes compete with the need to deliver products on a team. I think the company makes it hard sometimes to balance the two, and when you have to do both, you have to work a heavy load of hours to accomplish it all.   \n",

       "      <td>I decided to wait almost a year after leaving the company before posting a review.  The primary reason being is that when you decide to leave an organization it is usually because there is something there that isn't aligning with you or what you want anymore however, the grass is not always greener someplace else.  This has been my experience.  In fact, the appreciation I have for the company has grown so much in my time away that I would really like to return.\\n\\nThe company truly believes on promoting within and as an employee you are encouraged to grow your career within the organization and learn new skills by taking different positions.  Benefits are excellent.  Cisco is the industry leader for networking and now cloud.  It is sometimes easy to forget that on the daily grind but you are working for the company that everyone looks to for network and infrastructure standards.  Culture within the business units managing product lines give you a lot of freedom to be innovative and creative in your approach to your role.  In most cases you are given a fair amount of autonomy and control over how you do your job provided that it aligns with the strategic objectives.  Benefits, 401k match, RSUs and ESPP are amazing.  And while the salaries aren't the top of the industry, they are above market and pretty competitive.</td>\n",
       "      <td>Cisco can be a machine.  There isn't an overt demand for all of your time even the time outside of work but more of a subtle, slight encouragement to always be on.  If you are not careful, you will live, sleep and eat Cisco 24x7.  Don't get me wrong, this is 100% a choice and if you are aware of this subtlety in the culture it is very easy to set appropriate boundaries that will be respected by the company and leadership team.\\n\\nIf you don't like where you are in Cisco or what you are working on, give it 6 months because you will be reorg'd.  While it is sometimes necessary to realign the company to meet competitive threats or market demands, reorganizing the company once a year is excessive and tends to create a distrusting environment for the rank and file which makes being a leader in the organize challenging.  There is a loss of momentum and motivation that occurs a few months before and a few months after reorgs so this leaves the company being effective at delivery and execution only about 70% of the time.\\n\\nWhile Cisco attracts some bright, motivated people the truth of the matter is you are either cut out for the company and its culture or you're not.  If you aren't it will be painfully obvious to you and those around you.  Sadly as a leader it is hard to cut dead weight from the team and the only really accepted way is via layoffs, which is why the company reorgs once a year despite the company line about the reorgs.</td>\n",

The company encourages technical excellence, and there are pockets of genuinely supportive leadership. That said, the experience can vary dramatically depending on your org and manager, and some managers operate with impunity despite repeated and serious concerns.</td>\n",

Don’t expect HR, ER, or internal processes to intervene meaningfully, even when misconduct is extensively documented and corroborated by multiple witnesses. This toxic behavior often goes unpunished and actively rewarded—with visibility, advancement, incentives, and plenty of opportunities to retaliate against those who speak up.\\n\\nCisco has trimmed HR/ER and internal enforcement functions so much that the cultural messaging from the Cisco People Office feels performative and aspirational rather than reflective of groundlevel realities.</td>\n",

       "0     I decided to wait almost a year after leaving the company before posting a review.  The primary reason being is that when you decide to leave an organization it is usually because there is something there that isn't aligning with you or what you want anymore however, the grass is not always greener someplace else.  This has been my experience.  In fact, the appreciation I have for the company has grown so much in my time away that I would really like to return.\\n\\nThe company truly believes on promoting within and as an employee you are encouraged to grow your career within the organization and learn new skills by taking different positions.  Benefits are excellent.  Cisco is the industry leader for networking and now cloud.  It is sometimes easy to forget that on the daily grind but you are working for the company that everyone looks to for network and infrastructure standards.  Culture within the business units managing product lines give you a lot of freedom to be innovative and creative in your approach to your role.  In most cases you are given a fair amount of autonomy and control over how you do your job provided that it aligns with the strategic objectives.  Benefits, 401k match, RSUs and ESPP are amazing.  And while the salaries aren't the top of the industry, they are above market and pretty competitive.   \n",

As a senior systems engineer, I had the opportunity to collaborate with many thoughtful, capable, and genuine people across teams—from engineering and test to compliance, product management, executives, manufacturing, and TAC. The company encourages technical excellence, and there are pockets of genuinely supportive leadership. That said, the experience can vary dramatically depending on your org and manager, and some managers operate with impunity despite repeated and serious concerns.   \n",

       "0     Cisco can be a machine.  There isn't an overt demand for all of your time even the time outside of work but more of a subtle, slight encouragement to always be on.  If you are not careful, you will live, sleep and eat Cisco 24x7.  Don't get me wrong, this is 100% a choice and if you are aware of this subtlety in the culture it is very easy to set appropriate boundaries that will be respected by the company and leadership team.\\n\\nIf you don't like where you are in Cisco or what you are working on, give it 6 months because you will be reorg'd.  While it is sometimes necessary to realign the company to meet competitive threats or market demands, reorganizing the company once a year is excessive and tends to create a distrusting environment for the rank and file which makes being a leader in the organize challenging.  There is a loss of momentum and motivation that occurs a few months before and a few months after reorgs so this leaves the company being effective at delivery and execution only about 70% of the time.\\n\\nWhile Cisco attracts some bright, motivated people the truth of the matter is you are either cut out for the company and its culture or you're not.  If you aren't it will be painfully obvious to you and those around you.  Sadly as a leader it is hard to cut dead weight from the team and the only really accepted way is via layoffs, which is why the company reorgs once a year despite the company line about the reorgs.   \n",

Don’t expect HR, ER, or internal processes to intervene meaningfully, even when misconduct is extensively documented and corroborated by multiple witnesses. This toxic behavior often goes unpunished and actively rewarded—with visibility, advancement, incentives, and plenty of opportunities to retaliate against those who speak up.\\n\\nCisco has trimmed HR/ER and internal enforcement functions so much that the cultural messaging from the Cisco People Office feels performative and aspirational rather than reflective of groundlevel realities.   \n",

You will discover that more innovative/more approachable/results driven leadership comes in from external acquisitions rather than long time senior employees.\\n\\nAfter a certain point, growth heavily hinges on somebody senior 'sponsoring' you. Ergo, high performance on its own will not open doors at the upper middle to senior manager level.\\n\\nIt's a big company ~80K employees. Things can get lost.   \n",

      "The United States of America (U.S.A. or USA), commonly known as the United States (U.S. or US) or America, is a country primarily located in North America. It consists of 50 states, a federal district, five major unincorporated territories, 326 Indian reservations, and some minor possessions.[j] At 3.8 million square miles (9.8 million square kilometers), it is the world's third- or fourth-largest country by total area.[d] The United States shares significant land borders with Canada to the north and Mexico to the south, as well as limited maritime borders with the Bahamas, Cuba, and Russia.[22] With a population of more than 331 million people, it is the third most populous country in the world. The national capital is Washington, D.C., and the most populous city is New York.\n",

      "Paleo-Indians migrated from Siberia to the North American mainland at least 12,000 years ago, and European colonization began in the 16th century. The United States emerged from the thirteen British colonies established along the East Coast. Disputes over taxation and political representation with Great Britain led to the American Revolutionary War (1775–1783), which established independence. In the late 18th century, the U.S. began expanding across North America, gradually obtaining new territories, sometimes through war, frequently displacing Native Americans, and admitting new states; by 1848, the United States spanned the continent. Slavery was legal in the southern United States until the second half of the 19th century when the American Civil War led to its abolition. The Spanish–American War and World War I established the U.S. as a world power, a status confirmed by the outcome of World War II.\n",

The two superpowers competed in the Space Race, culminating in the 1969 spaceflight that first landed humans on the Moon. The Soviet Union's dissolution in 1991 ended the Cold War, leaving the United States as the world's sole superpower.\n",

      "The United States is a federal republic and a representative democracy with three separate branches of government, including a bicameral legislature. It is a founding member of the United Nations, World Bank, International Monetary Fund, Organization of American States, NATO, and other international organizations. It is a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council. Considered a melting pot of cultures and ethnicities, its population has been profoundly shaped by centuries of immigration. The country ranks high in international measures of economic freedom, quality of life, education, and human rights, and has low levels of perceived corruption. However, the country has received criticism concerning inequality related to race, wealth and income, the use of capital punishment, high incarceration rates, and lack of universal health care.\n",

Making up more than a third of global military spending, it is the foremost military power in the world; and it is a leading political, cultural, and scientific force internationally.[23]\n"
